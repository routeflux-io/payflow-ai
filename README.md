# PayFlow AI

PayFlow AI is an intelligent payment recovery and optimization platform designed to improve transaction success rates across African payment systems. The platform detects failed transactions in real time, analyzes failure patterns, and uses AI-driven decision logic to automatically retry payments using optimized timing or routing strategies. By introducing an intelligent recovery layer on top of existing payment infrastructure, PayFlow AI helps businesses reduce revenue loss, improves user trust in digital payments, and enhances overall payment reliability within the ecosystem.

## 🚨 Problem Statement
```markdown
Digital payments across Africa frequently fail due to network instability, bank downtime, and transaction timeouts. 

When payments fail:
- Users retry manually
- Merchants lose revenue
- Trust in digital payments decreases

Existing payment systems stop at failure. PayFlow AI introduces an intelligent recovery layer that improves payment success rates automatically.
